## Source Code and Building
AHJ (AutoHelljacks) is built using the Desktop Qt 6.2.2 MinGW 64-bit kit, provided by Qt. In order to build it, follow the instructions below.
1. Download Qt. [This](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) links to an installer that can help you download the right version. As noted previously, AHJ is built with **Desktop Qt 6.2.2 MinGW 64-bit kit**. 
2. Once you have downloaded and installed Qt, launch Qt Creator. Do not create a project. 
3. Download the files in the repository. These will probably be in .zip format, so extract it to a folder. This folder will be where your project is.
4. Click on the Open button on the Welcome > Projects menu. Go to the folder where you extracted the files, and click on the project file. You will then be opened up to the project.

A quick note: Despite `titles.txt` being empty, the actual release has the titles contained within it. This was done to make it a little more fun, but if you absolutely need the list of titles you are free to DM me.
